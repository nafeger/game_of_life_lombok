This is a simple app, that attempts to jam a few features together.

1. Write my first implementation of the game of life
2. Use gradle for the build
3. Use project lombok whenever possible
4. Use java 8's streams and Ranges whenever I can.

Please note to import this into intellij you should make sure to check the 
Compiler > Annotation Processors > [x] Enable Annotation Processing

I have provided a few example screens in the examples directory

java com.nate_land.gol_lombok.Driver filename permutationcount to execute them.
